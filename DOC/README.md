## Types of Data Structures

- Physical
- Logical

### Physical Data Structure

1. Array
2. Linked List

***We can have more physical data structures using the combination of array and linked List.***

#### Array
- Directly Supported by the program
- array is the collection of contiguous memory location
- The size cannot cannot be increased or decreased 
- **Size** - Static
- **Memory** - Both Static or Heap
- **When To Use** - When the size is Know

#### Linked List
- Collection of nodes are dynamically allocated, each nodes contain a data and link to the next node.
- The length of the list can be increased -or- decreased
- We can add or delete node -or- elements from the list
- **Size** - Dynamic
- **Memory** - Heap
- **When To Use** - When the size is Unknown
- Head Pointer will be pointing in the stack

**Both Physical Data Structures are actually stores the data in the memory directly.**



### Logical Data Structures

- Stack - LIFO
- Queue - FIFO
- Trees
- Graph
- Hash Tables

1. Linear DS - Stack, Queue
2. Non Linear DS - Trees, Graph
3. Linear -or- Tabular - Hash Table
